This app is a sorting algorithm visualizer. The front end is created using React to build a dynamic user interface, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JacaScript to implement the algorithms and fuctionality. You can choose to generate new data to sort and choose between bubble sorting, merge sorting, and selection sorting. Once the sorting is complete the app will show you the result for 5 seconds before restting to the original random assortment.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
